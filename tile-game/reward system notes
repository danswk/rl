# SUCCESS
- Action, reward system work as expected
- Agent performance improves substantially with reinforcement
  - Playing without reinforcement consistently produces 0 wins (win = goal reached/1짜리 reward achieved)
  - Playing with reinforcement often produces wins in range 8-19
    - Best success rate observed: 47.5%

# FAIL
- Agent performance with reinforcement unstable
  - Some plays produce few, 0 wins

# FIX
- Tweak model type/parameters to aim for consistent 50%< success rate
  - GridSearchCV
~
- tile game/playtest.mp4 shows agent behaviour when movement is randomised
  - No exploitation system - all movement is exploration
